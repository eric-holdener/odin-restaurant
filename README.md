This is a project in TheOdinProjects Javascript course, to teach the concept of using JS to build multiple different pages of a website.

Each page has its own JS file, and are bundled togegher using the Webpack module.

The general project did not give me too many issues, but I am currently in the middle of transitioning to a split layout keyboard with the Colemak layout, meaning I am essentially relearning how to type right now, making my projects be a lot more slow and methodical.

This ir the main reason I decided to not style and host this project, as I would rather to continue to focus my efforts on learning and not tediously typing at a slow WPM to style the webpage. I will most likely be revisiting this page in the future to add the finishing touches.
